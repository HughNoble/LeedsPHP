February's event is at [Futurelabs](http://futurelabs.org.uk/).

There will be some bottles of beer, coffee, soft drinks, and pizza provided. This is our third month at Futurelabs in an attempt to open the event up to a wider audience who may not be comfortable meeting in a pub; So, please, if you know anyone who might be interested in attending who previously didn't want to, let them know. We want to be accessible for all.

# The Talks

## Love and Hate relationship between ORMs and Query Builders - Romans Malinovskis

> While some developers prefer writing their own SQL queries, others prefer to abstract the database with Object Relational Mappers. Is there a middle-ground that incorporates both without compromising and resulting in limitations?<br/><br/>This talk will focus on database abstraction, query latency & domain model and persistence mapping patterns in PHP applications. It will introduce the core concepts behind "Agile Data" - (database abstraction library available under MIT from [github.com/atk4/data](http://github.com/atk4/data)).

Romans is an author of "Agile Data" and an active PHP / SaaS developer since 1997.
