# The Talks

## MQTT signalling and using Node-Red to facilitate I/O and interface to on-line services – Brian Ackroyd

This talk will give people an appreciation of how it's easily possible to send MQTT messages and then progress to interface to that technology in Node-Red to control things. Examples might include controlling the brightness of an LED, as well as switch Internet Radio stations, and interface with Twitter and http.

* MQ Telemetry Transport or Message Queue Telemetry Transport - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT)
* Node-RED is a software tool developed by IBM for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services as part of the Internet of Things. - [https://nodered.org/](https://nodered.org/)

Brian is a regular at LeedsPHP with many an interesting story to tell - We're looking forward to this one!

## Docker and Symfony console – Gareth Midwood

This is going to be a beginner level talk about Docker and Symfony console, and how @ Creode we're building our own open source command line app to simplify the configuration and running of our Docker projects, and why you might want to do the same
