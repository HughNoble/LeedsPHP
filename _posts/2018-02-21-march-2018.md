# The Talks

## Coding Horrors - A Horror Film Fan's Guide to PHP Coding Nightmares

### Mark Baker [@Mark_Baker](https://twitter.com/Mark_Baker)

> Most of us are probably aware of code smells, code that doesn't apply SOLID principles, code that should be refactored to make the system easier to maintain. But there are other coding horrors that should trigger alarm bells whenever we see them, whether in a legacy codebase or when doing code reviews. Like a good horror movie, coding horrors should scare us when we find them, because they're often symptomatic of deeper problems. So let's take a short tour of some of the greatest horror movies ever made (and a few turkeys); and some of the most worrying code horrors that I've seen.

Mark is ZCE; Lead/Senior Developer at Paybreak; Coordinator of Open Source PHPOffice library suite (PHPExcel, PHPPowerPoint, PHPWord, &c); Trainee cat herder.

## A journey into API performance and security using PHP Silex

### Blair Garrett [@blairguk](https://twitter.com/blairguk)

> Just want to take you through the practices, tools and techniques I employed when making my best attempt to secure and speed up API’s. For this talk I’ll be using the PHP Silex framework. I’ll go through the reasons for my choice of tools which you can lean on. These will ensure your API goes like the clappers and the bad guys can’t get in. This is loosely based on a read world example. But I will be drawing on experience of creating API’s in Java, .NET, PHP and NodeJS over the years.

Blair is a Developer at Sky. Previously Senior Developer and Data Architect at Saint-Gobain. Amateur fell runner, former amateur tennis player and golfer. And I used to climb up rocks.
