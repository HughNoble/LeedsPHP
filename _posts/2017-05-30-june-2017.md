# The Talks

## Sky News: The Journey from Node.js to PHP - Brendan Quigley

> In mid-2015 we began migrating the Sky News website from Node.js to Symfony.  In the year that followed, we overhauled how we build PHP apps in the Digital Content tribe at Sky, leading to a cleaner, more testable, and more modular codebase.<br/><br/>This talk will cover that journey, from our initial decisions through to going live… and a little beyond.

Brendan is a senior software engineer in the Digital Content tribe at Sky, which looks after the Sky News and Sky Sports digital estate. He has also worked as a solutions architect in the tribe, as well as doing very interesting things previously at digital agency 9xb and travel search engine icelolly.com.

## Alexa PHP: Using serverless asynchronous PHP for Alexa bus timetables - Chris Bell

> In this session, I'll be demonstrating how to build a practical Alexa skill running on AWS Lambda, using PHP 7. We'll use the serverless framework to package and deploy our function. We'll also touch on how asynchronous PHP can help improve our function execution time.<br/><br/>If you're interested in PHP, AWS Lambda, Function as a Service (FaaS), serverless framework, docker or promises - this talk is for you.

Chris Bell is a clean coder with lean principles. He recently led a large international project for Sky Sport Deutschland. Chris is co-organiser of LeedsPHP and the indie developer behind [SalaryBot Salary Calculator](https://salarybot.co.uk/).
