May's event is at [Futurelabs](http://futurelabs.org.uk/).

There will be some bottles of beer, coffee, soft drinks, and pizza provided. We're back at Futurelabs in an attempt to open the event up to a wider audience who may not be comfortable meeting in a pub; So, please, if you know anyone who might be interested in attending who previously didn't want to, let them know. We want to be accessible for all.

# The Talks

## What's My Name? – Brian Teeman

> In the multicultural world that we live in how do you know my name. Is my first name my last name? What is my family name and what should you call me. As web site developers we regularly ask people for their name so we can personalise the web, but are we using the correct name?

Brian Teeman is: Co-founder Joomla! Speaker at Joomla! and Open Source events around the world. #joomla #founder

## Mental Health in the Tech Industry – Chad Gowler

> Mental health is something that will affect most of us. The tech industry is high-paced and high pressure, and this means that we may be leaving some developers to struggle. This talk will examine touchpoints such as meetings, code review and timesheets and think about ways that they could cause difficulty. We will think about how we can make them easier to navigate so that developers can get back doing to what they do best.

Chad is a software engineer at Sky in Leeds. They have also dipped their toe into project management, user testing, interaction design and event organising. They are a firm believer in inclusive software and digital inclusion. In their spare time, they can be found in various usergroups talking about gender, mental health and gaming for social good.
