This month Tom Hudson will be live-coding a Virtual Machine in PHP. Languages like Java and PHP compile to bytecode that runs on a 'Virtual Machine'. Tom is going to walk us through building a simple VM from the ground up to illustrate how they work.

As always we'll be upstairs in the Adelphi, with sponsored food and drink courtesy of Conex.

We're a free event and open to all. Whether you've been along before or not, we look forward to seeing you soon. :-)
