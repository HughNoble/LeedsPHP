Happy New Year! Leeds PHP returns on Monday 19th January at 19:00 in the Adelphi. This month we have Martyn Ranyard presenting "OwnCloud - is deGoogling hard?"

A short exploration of the services provided by OwnCloud - the top opensource (PHP) private cloud services platform. The talk will include a live demo of connecting a virtual android device to OwnCloud.
