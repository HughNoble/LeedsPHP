# The Talks

## API Development with Laravel – Michael Peacock

### Michael Peacock [@michaelpeacock](https://twitter.com/michaelpeacock)

> Laravel makes it really easy to build APIs, we will explore how to use it to build powerful and flexible APIs. We will cover how to use Passport to support oAuth authentication, how to build flexible responses with Transformers and how to rapidly build RESTful logic in our application.

Michael is a software engineer and consultant CTO helping early stage SaaS startups build products, teams and processes. When he isn’t developing software, Michael can often be found speaking or writing about it.
