# The Talks

## Building websites with Zend Expressive 2 - Rob Allen

### Rob Allen [@akrabat](https://twitter.com/akrabat)

We’re very pleased to have Rob Allen speaking. Rob is Lead developer of [Slim Framework](https://www.slimframework.com), Author, and conference speaker.

> Zend Expressive 2 is the ideal framework for building PHP applications of all types. Its easy-to-understand architecture makes it ideal for projects of all shapes and sizes. In this talk, I'll show you how to build an Expressive application than can scale with your needs. We will look at how Expressive's middleware system leverages the upcoming PSR-15 specification to create easily understandable and flexible applications. We will cover application setup, routing and error handling before diving into some thoughts on how architect an Expressive application. By the end of the session, you will be equipped to create Expressive applications yourself.
