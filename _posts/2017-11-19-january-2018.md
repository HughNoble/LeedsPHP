# The Talks

## Building websites with Zend Expressive 2 - Rob Allen
### Rob Allen [@akrabat](https://twitter.com/akrabat)

We’re very pleased to have Rob Allen speaking. Rob is Lead developer of [Slim Framework](https://www.slimframework.com), Author, and conference speaker.

> Zend Expressive 2 is the ideal framework for building PHP applications of all types. Its easy-to-understand architecture makes it ideal for projects of all shapes and sizes. In this talk, I'll show you how to build an Expressive application than can scale with your needs. We will look at how Expressive's middleware system leverages the upcoming PSR-15 specification to create easily understandable and flexible applications. We will cover application setup, routing and error handling before diving into some thoughts on how architect an Expressive application. By the end of the session, you will be equipped to create Expressive applications yourself.

## TBA
### You?

We’re looking for another speaker. If you've got something you've been working on, an opinion to give, a discussion to host, whatever, we would love top have you speak. Please tweet us [@leedsphp](https://twitter.com/leedsphp).

# You do the intro!

For you to get the taste for public speaking we're asking one of the attendees to do the event introduction. You'll speak briefly about the sponsors, any announcements, and talk about the next event - it'll take less than 5 minutes, but may help to ease your fear of public speaking! If you're interested in doing this please tweet @leedsphp (https://twitter.com/leedsphp). We'll send you the slides beforehand with a few points to mention. The rest is up to you!
