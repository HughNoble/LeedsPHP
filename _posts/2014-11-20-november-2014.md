Writing effective tests with Behat by Iain Cambridge
The key to an effective test suite is writing good scenarios. During this talk we'll look at an example of an extremely badly written scenario and the steps to making it better - resulting in something that is usable and valuable as a test. By the end we should know a little more about how to write contexts for effective tests.

This November event will be our last proper meet up in 2014! After Iain's talk we hope to spend a few minutes discussing what everyone would like to see from the group in 2015 and beyond.
