Following on from our month off in March, this meetup will be a social event - a catch up and discussion about PHP and it's recent developments, coupled with a chat regarding improvements to the LeedsPHP group.

LeedsPHP has been running for quite a number of years now, but we don't want to rest on our laurels. The world of web development and software engineering moves so fast, and PHP is moving with it. We want this group to reflect the modern challenges and problems that we encounter as developers, and we'd like as much input as possible into how the group can help us learn and grow.

So please do come along - despite the lack of a specific talk, and help to ensure that LeedsPHP remains a valuable event in your social calendar in the coming months and years. :-)
