The talks are as follows…

# RegEx Is Your Friend – Liam Wiltshire

> RegEx is scary. At least, if you ask Google, that's what you might think (257,000). And slow (441,000). In fact, regular expressions are neither of these, and indeed are a powerful tool in your utility belt.

> In "RegEx Is Your Friend", Liam aims to provide some real-world and usable examples of how it can be used in a way that's fast, explaining how the different parts of regular expressions work and execute to make it understandable for all.

# Passwords and how to handle them – Chris Riley

> Like it or not, passwords form an essential part of nearly all user authentication systems, yet so many companies make basic mistakes when handling them. Often a password forms the only means of security for a user's account on multiple different websites so we all have a responsibility to handle this data properly. 

> During this talk I will go over some of the common mistakes people make surrounding password policies and elaborate on the golden rules for storing them securely.
