This month we have Stephen Melrose who will be talking about how building an application is only half the battle. Anyone who’s taken an application from development to production will tell you that it’s not as simple as it sounds. Stephen will talk about an application he recently built and deployed at Sky Bet and focuses on some of the steps that need to be taken in order to put an application into production, such as load testing and monitoring, and some of the enablers around them.

Stephen Melrose
Stephen is a self-employed Software Engineering contractor, having formerly worked for Sky Bet and MadeByPi.
