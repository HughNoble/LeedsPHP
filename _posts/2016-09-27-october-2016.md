This month's event is at the [Adelphi](https://www.theadelphileeds.co.uk/). Chip butties and a drink or two from the bar will be provided as usual by our sponsors [Inviqa](http://inviqa.com/) and [Sky Betting & Gaming](http://skybetcareers.com/about-us).

I'll get there early and make sure the chips come out in a timely manner so we're not all waiting around this time!

See you then, then.

Please RSVP on <button>[meetup](http://www.meetup.com/leedsphp/events/234447269/)</button> so we get an idea of numbers, and please, tell your friends!

The talks are as follows…

# Dockerising CI Pipelines – Paul Dragoonis

> This talk is intermediate level and should have a bit of something for everyone whether you’re building a standard pipeline (non-docker) or already have a pipeline and looking to see how Docker will make it even stronger. I will demonstrate how building pipelines with Docker differs from traditional pipelines and what steps are involved in migrating from traditional pipelines to Docker ones. I will share my experiences, tips and tricks, and lessons learned on my journey into docker land.

# ADR Design Pattern – James King

> James will be talking us through the "Action, Domain, Responder" design pattern which has been gaining a lot of popularity in the last few years. He'll explain how it differs from the traditional MVC, and how it makes much more sense than MVC.
