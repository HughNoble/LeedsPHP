February's event is at [Futurelabs](http://futurelabs.org.uk/).

There will be some bottles of beer, coffee, soft drinks, and pizza provided. This is our second month at Futurelabs in an attempt to open the event up to a wider audience who may not be comfortable meeting in a pub; So, please, if you know anyone who might be interested in attending who previously didn't want to, let them know. We want to be accessible for all.

# The Talks

## Behaviour Driven Development & Behat: Telling stories through code - Matt Brunt

> Stories? Scenarios? BDD? Are these just more words in the ever-growing list of jargon that developers have to know? Or are they something more important than new terms to memorise?<br/><br/>In this session we'll look at how BDD fits into the software development work-flow, how to tell user stories through features, and how to automate them in Behat.<br/><br/>These techniques will help to ensure you're writing well designed and tested software that focuses on what the users want from a system.

Matt us Senior Software Engineer at Viva IT Limited. Mentoring a team and fostering a culture of sharing, learning, openness and quality. Player of tabletop and RPG games, Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Master. Flier of fast first-person-view quadcopters. Lover of jaffa cakes.

## What Makes a Senior Developer?

> We're going to have an open discussion to talk about what qualities and skills you need to gain the title of "Senior". How does this vary between companies and environments? What are some tangible things you can do to become one? Have a think, bring your experiences and ideas and we'll see what we get.

## Competition!

Sign up to this event on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/leedsphp/events/237362520/) and turn up on the night, we'll pull your name out of a hat (it may be an electronic hat). What can you win? Some good old fashioned programming books provided by our sponsors. Not very competitive, admittedly, but you stand a good chance of winning!
