Please RSVP on <button>[meetup](http://www.meetup.com/leedsphp/events/231488991/)</button>

The talks are as follows…

# Writing code you won’t hate tomorrow – Pete McFarlane

> How many times have you looked back at code you wrote a year ago and had a sinking feeling? How many times have you taken over a project from someone else and wanted to re-write everything?
> Writing software is relatively easy, but designing software that is elegant, efficient and adaptable requires much more effort. I’m going to share three qualities of good code I believe are worth striving for, showing some practical code examples, and helping you to transform bad code to better code.
