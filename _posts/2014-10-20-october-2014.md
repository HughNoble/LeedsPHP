Boost your git skills in this session where we pick out some of the most handy but underused features of an excellent tool. If you're confident committing, branching and merging, then come along and collect the next set of skills, to include bisect, rebasing, adding patches rather than files, the rerere command, and some tricks for handling multiple remotes. We'll also look at using configuration files: your own config, the gitignore file and how to teach gitattributes about the different types of file in your project. Anyone using git on a regular basis will learn some new tricks in this session.

FYI - Lorna is also running a one day Git course at Retrograde Academy on the same day (during the day, before our meetup). If that's of interest, you can find more details on Eventbrite.

Please confirm your attendance for this months LeedsPHP on Eventbrite or Meetup. Thanks!
