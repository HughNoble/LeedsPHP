April's event is at [Futurelabs](http://futurelabs.org.uk/).

There will be some bottles of beer, coffee, soft drinks, and pizza provided. This is our fourth month at Futurelabs in an attempt to open the event up to a wider audience who may not be comfortable meeting in a pub; So, please, if you know anyone who might be interested in attending who previously didn't want to, let them know. We want to be accessible for all.

# The Talks

## ~~Flashtalking driving Ad Technology using PHP - Duren Dexter~~

Unfortunately Duren had to cancel :(

> Find out how Flashtalking uses PHP to build, serve and measure over 1 billion adverts a day.

Duren Dexter, MD of technology for Flashtalking, started his career in tech working on satellite systems while in the US Air Force as well as at MIT.  He has since travelled the globe working in senior technology roles in sports betting (Betfair- Global, Skybet International) & now advertising technology with Flashtalking.
