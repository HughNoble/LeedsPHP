January's event, in a break from tradition, is at [Futurelabs](http://futurelabs.org.uk/).

There will be some bottles of beer, coffee, soft drinks, and pizza provided.  It's been moved here in an attempt to open the event up to a wider audience who may not be comfortable meeting in a pub; So, please, if you know anyone who might be interested in attending who previously didn't want to, let them know. We want to be accessible for all.

# The Talks

## Kickass Development Environments With Docker – David McKay

> Docker, the hottest technology around at the moment. It swept the Ops world by storm in 2014, became mainstream in 2015, and now it’s set to dominate the developer world, in 2016.  
Docker is a tool that allows you to package your application up into a single-runnable distributable binary - akin to the phar, but in Hulk mode. Docker allows you, a developer, to specify the exact environment your application needs to run, across development; test; staging; and production.  
In this talk David will cover the creation of this utopian distributable and show you how to can compose your entire production infrastructure locally with only a small YAML file and without installing a single thing.  
Lets say hello, to Docker.

## Philosophy of Programming – Michael J. Burgess

> What is programming? What are programs? What are programmers doing when they write programs? What is a successful program? In this session we will explore programming as a modeling activity comparing it with art and science. And how programming relates to issues such as truth, knowledge, representation and intentionality.
