LeedsPHP is a non-profit group to discuss and share knowledge about PHP and related web technologies. We meet monthly (probably) and enjoy a few talks from locals or people who have traveled further afield.

It's open to any skill level from beginners to experts alike and we try to vary the levels so as to not alienate anyone.

The meetups aren't open to recruiters.

## Sponsorship

We're currently sponsored by [Sky Bet](https://www.skybet.com/cms/careers.shtm) and [Inviqa](http://inviqa.com/) who pay for the venue, food, and drinks. We thank them for their support.
