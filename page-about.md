LeedsPHP is a non-profit group to discuss and share knowledge about PHP and
related web technologies. We meet monthly (probably) and enjoy a few talks from
locals or people who have traveled further afield.

It's open to any skill level from beginners to experts alike and we try to vary
the levels so as to not alienate anyone.

The meet-ups aren't open to recruiters unless you're just popping along in a
learning capacity.

## Sponsorship

Our long term sponsors can be seen in the footer of this page. Additional
meet-up specific sponsors will be detailed on the individual event pages.

If you would like to provide further sponsorship, long term, or for a particular
events get in touch via [twitter](https://twitter.com/leedsphp).

## Code of Conduct

LeedsPHP is dedicated to providing harassment-free meet up experiences for
everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any
meet up venue or online discussion. LeedsPHP members violating these rules may
be sanctioned or expelled from the group at the discretion of the group's
organisers.
